Day 2 - System Design & Integration: Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025
System Design Overview
On Day 2 of my Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025 journey, I focused on designing the system architecture, defining how the frontend will communicate with the backend, and planning the integration of third-party APIs. The goal is to ensure a scalable, efficient, and seamless marketplace experience.

Frontend-Backend Integration
Frontend Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS with ShadCn UI
State Management: Redux
Backend Architecture
CMS: Sanity.io
API Handling: RESTful APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Third-Party API Integration: Payment gateway and product availability services
Communication Flow
The frontend will interact with the backend using HTTP requests, ensuring smooth data retrieval and updates.

Third-Party API Integration
Purpose of Third-Party API
Payment Processing: Secure online transactions
Product Availability: Fetch real-time stock updates
Integration Approach
The frontend sends a request to the backend.
The backend processes the request and interacts with the third-party API.
The backend returns a response to the frontend, updating the UI accordingly.
Security Measures
HTTPS for secure communication
API Key Authentication to prevent unauthorized access
API Routes Definition
Product Management APIs
GET /api/products ‚Üí Fetch all available products
Order Management APIs
POST /api/order ‚Üí Create a new order
GET /api/order/:id ‚Üí Retrieve order details
PUT /api/order/:id ‚Üí Update order status (e.g., shipped, delivered)
Payment Processing APIs
GET /api/payment/verify ‚Üí Verify payment status
Additional routes will be added for advanced payment gateway functionalities.

Tech Stack Summary
Component	Technology Used
Frontend	Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCn UI
State Management	Redux
Backend	Sanity.io
Authentication	Clerk
API Integration	Third-party payment processing & product availability
System Workflow & Data Flow
User Interaction: A user interacts with the marketplace (e.g., viewing products, placing orders).
Frontend Requests: The frontend sends API requests to fetch or update data.
Backend Processing: The backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and communicates with third-party APIs.
Response Handling: The backend sends responses back to the frontend.
UI Update: The frontend dynamically updates based on the response received.

Next Steps
Now that the system architecture is in place, the next steps will focus on:
‚úÖ Implementing API Routes
‚úÖ Integrating Third-Party Services
‚úÖ Starting Frontend Development to connect all components

üöÄ Day 2 Recap
Today‚Äôs focus was on laying out the system architecture, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and third-party services. The next phase is to bring this system to life by implementing these integrations into a working prototype!
